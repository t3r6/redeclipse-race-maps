This is another concept idea for a tutorial, hopefully not an entirely useless one: A timetrial map for offline use with a few triggers that successively unlock the various impulse moves and give you some instructions about each of them as they are enabled. I tried to keep the outline as simple and clear as possible.
There is absolutely no art on this map yet, so this is simply a concept to test the mechanics. This version does not include any texturing, lighting, decorative geometry and clipping, particles or sounds, and the hub area is just a placeholder. If you feel like adding any of these, you are explicitly allowed to do so. Also, I am not a native speaker, so the instructions may not always be as clear as they should be.

Kicks with zero push still allow you to boost again, so there are actually plenty of shortcuts (just spam Q and space to climb up walls).

A hint for the final obstacle: Try some wall running as you fall down to the lower ceiling.

Tutorial triggers are located in the .cfg file.

Changes in v0.2
- Holo bots (mapmodels) that give you a clue where exactly to jump, boost, kick or slide
- Slightly different variables to disable impulse moves, thus some different ordering and instructions.
- The wall running and impulse boost sections should be easier to complete now
- First attempt to support custom key bindings in the instructions
- Still no textures or art stuff whatsoever

Changes in v0.2.1
- The first bot now resets the movement to defaults
- Moved deprecated guititle dialog to guilist for RE 1.6
- Decreased impulsekickdelay in the last rooms for RE 1.6
- Deprecated variable impulseallowed was replaced with playerabilities
For reference: impulseallowed (15 = default, 0 = off, 1 = dash, 2 = boost, 4 = pacing, 8 = parkour)
- Aligned parameters for RE 1.6
- Fixed dialogue numeration
