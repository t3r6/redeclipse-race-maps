The geometry of rooms 1, 6 and 9 corresponds to the map HardCore by [RM]Temka.

Rooms 2, 4 and 5 and partly 12 were designed by TristamK as well as the portal shaders and the choice of the texture set. 

Map remix, additional rooms, sky lighting and challenge texts by Bonifarz.

Version 0.3 changes
I made an update with some adjustments to rooms 10 and 11. Kicks are a bit more difficult now.
Since only start checkpoints start the timer, I added some teleports that allow you to access all other rooms from room zero: Just launch at the ceiling for testing or practice.

Version 0.2 changes
The eleventh section was way too easy compared to the tenth or ninth.
With this update, I tried my best to make the spin-jump challenge a tough one. The room can be passed in two ways for sure, but both require some very precise timing.
