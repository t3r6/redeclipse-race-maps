Hidek is a small trial map by [RM] Temka with an industrial theme, some strange clipping and an otherwise very open layout suitable for freestyle running. The concept map Twisted is based on Hidek : The player explores six variations of the same environment, each with a different normal vector for the gravity. Initially some particle arrows indicate where to go, but as the players progress they need some good sense of direction to find their way.
