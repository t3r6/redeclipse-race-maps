Changes

version 1.1c
* mapmusic path is changed form "sounds/music/GalacticTemple.ogg" to "maps/tonatiuh.ogg"
version 1.1b
* Tilted spikes block fixed - yeah, i never noticed that one
* Clipped the sniper spot so it does no longer work as super-difficult shortcut
* Checked again that all torches have noclip and clipped slopes
* Moved the trial start to the entrance
* Some minor changes hardly noticeable
version 1.1
* Finally added a start checkpoint. Reason: ticket 585
* Noclip on all spikes to prevent weird collision
version 1.0
* Added "random" variations to the length of the spikes.
* Added decorative geometry: Demonical statue.

* fixed positions of some trees and all torch particles.
* Removed the sandbox at the top.
version 0.8
* Recreated parts of the golden mask geometry.
* New spike geometry for corners.
* Added a few "easter eggs", hidden paths that are not shortcuts.
* Raised numplayers to avoid spawn queues.
version 0.7
* Both dmo records are included, one easy way (new), one fast time (97s).
* Added some mine turrets for onslaught trial (/trialghost 0, /minesub1/2 0).
* Added an affinity and player starts for gauntlet, but this is "mission impossible" since checkpoints are ignored.
* Added a few gaps and shattered bricks (un-/clipped) to break up some monotony.
* Fixed some torches that lost some flags via copy/paste
version 0.6.1
* One corridor was again too dark, therefore the small update.

* Moved a respawn-point and added another one.
* Clip around and noclip on the torches.
* Most checkpoints are now marked with hexagonal stone plates.
* Decorative geometry: Stone statue.
* Decorative geometry: Grim face - damn, that's really not easy to model with octrees =)
* Some simple stone ceilings added.
* Light colour, vlayer texture and cloud vars adjusted as suggested by TristamK.
* A bit of dark red fog, not sure if it really helps here.
* Some compromise with the relative size of light ents/models/particles.
* New finish particles, teleport points now to the temple entrance.
* 3 Screenshots updated
* dmo file updated, but I am too lazy now to make a good one ;)
version 0.5
* Two more checkpoints when kicking around the sun orb
* Lots of blendmap painting inside and outside the temple
* Colder ambient light
* Some changes in the outdoor geometry
version 0.4
* The narrow corridors are now as wide as a standing player
* Blendmaps added to paint mossy temple walls
* Lightprecision bumped up to 128 to keep the file size reasonable
* The spike patterns are not as symmetric anymore
* Various decorative geometry fixes
* Some 180 tree mapmodels added
version 0.3
* Final spike section reworked
* "Diagonal" spikes as decorative geometry
Version 0.2
* Glitching through slopes should be fixed, crouch jumping works now as it should.
* Wall running around the sun sphere  is much easier now. The old route serves as a shortcut.
* Lighting changes around and inside the sun sphere.
