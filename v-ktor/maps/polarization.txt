Polarization v4

This is a singleplayer map! Start a onslaught-gauntlet or onslaught-timetrial on this map. The alpha team has to reach the space ship and omega team tries to stop them in gauntlet mode.
If you want to play it with other players I suggest to use coop, but this is not possible. It's hard enough with cpu players in the omega team. It'll take at least 20min to finish this map, so you should put timelimit to 100 (teams will be changed after the half of the time if you play gauntlet).

When I tested the map I died 20 times. There are so many grunts that it'll take some time untill everyone spawned.
I also tried kaboom-onslaught-gauntlet with 15 bots. They are all walking around the alpha start causing many explosions.
