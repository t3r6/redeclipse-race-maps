Trespass by Greaser, JD, Rabidbutton v2.1

This map started out as a collaboration between me, JD, and Rabidbutton over a month ago. Since then, I've been fixing it up with their help and the help of others who provided feedback. Now, it's ready for the world to see.

Tresspass is mainly an arena deathmatch map for 2-6 players (team or non-team) but it can also be played in CTF. It's set in the middle of an old, Earth-style city, right near an old nuclear power plant, with looming skyscrapers bearing the names of corporations that once ruled the metropolis.

Also, JD discovered that there's a pretty cool parkour path among the skyscrapers, so I decided to make it playable for Time-Trial and Gauntlet; also, if the jetpack mutator is selected, you spawn outside the clip of the arena and can play a big, open match somewhat like Center. (Still, playing inside the arena is recommended)

Changes

Quick Update, April 16:
-Correctly named
-used Quin's suggestion, made invisible walls for dm/ctf/dtf/bb that disappear in gauntlet/time trial
-gauntlet players now spawn inside the map


Update June 4:
-reworked outside buildings; kool-aid pool is now full nuclear stack. Also looks less prominent on minimap
-More indications for timetrial/gauntlet that disappear in other modes where the goal is
-very minor texturing adjustments
-faster path no longer exists
-time-trial starts inside, like Bonifarz suggested
