A single player version of Escape for race and campaign game modes.
The map contains a hidden area at the end. It consists of a button/jump puzzle where you have a white and blue colored door with a corresponding colored button to find. This is ended with a long sequence jump.

Changes
I have fixed most of the checkpoints so after you open each door you get a new checkpoint. I also made a few of the jumps easier.

Instructions

Move the contents of the map folder into your Red Eclipse map directory

/data/maps

Move the Folder 'escape' into the Red Eclipse Sounds folder

/data/sounds
