You are one of the workers on the Space Scientific Complex, called "Cepheus", and you are in the water reservoir, number 083.
Unfortunately, there was a serious crash, and now water is polluted with dangerous bacteria, which can absorb any material on it's way.
As you can imagine, human bones is not the problem.

You are the last survivor.
Help yourself to find the way out.

Good luck!
