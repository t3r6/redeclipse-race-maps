Revisit
Euphoria

This is an sort of remake from Bionic commando Rearmed 2's challenge rooms.
They are the same layout as the originals, but the thing is, you can parkour through it with no problems!
There are 5 rooms. I will remake the other 15 ones when I feel like doing it.
The thing is, I made it as you could see the other player's progress through the map if you look at the sides.
Room 4 will give some problems if you don't have too much sense of balance.
PS: Don't touch the blue walls!
